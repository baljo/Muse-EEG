# Introduction
This is the first in a series of project where you learn everything from playing a very simplistic Pong game by blinking your eyes, to more advanced controlling of software or external devices with the help of a consumer-based EEG-device.
## Prerequisites
To be able to reproduce examples found in this tutorial, you'll need:
 - A Muse EEG-device, any model should work, although Muse-01 (from 2014) streams with 220 Hz instead of 256 Hz and might need a few code changes. They cost around 250 USD/EUR and are manufactured by the Canadian company [Interaxon Inc.](https://choosemuse.com/) 
 -  iPhone or Android phone
 - [Mind Monitor app](https://mind-monitor.com/) for iPhone or Android, one-time price is ~15 USD/EUR
 - A computer able to run Python + WiFi
	 - only PC/Win10 tested although Mac and Linux computers are expected to work
	 - Muse communicates with your phone and Mind Monitor through Bluetooth, and Mind Monitor communicates through WiFi with your computer
